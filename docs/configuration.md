# Configuration

This document is the complete reference for the Issuerd server configuration
file (`issuerd.toml`). It is written for system operators and administrators
who deploy and run Issuerd. Every key, default, and behavior described here is
implemented in `crates/issuerd-server/src/config.rs` and the daemon startup path
(`src/main.rs`, `crates/issuerd-server/src/state.rs`). For first-time setup see
[getting-started.md](getting-started.md); for realm/client content as code see
[provisioning.md](provisioning.md).

## How configuration is loaded

Configuration is assembled from three layers, later layers winning:

1. **Built-in defaults** — every key has one (see the reference tables below).
   With no file and no environment, the daemon boots on in-memory storage,
   plain HTTP on `0.0.0.0:8080`.
2. **Config file** — passed with `-c` / `--config`:
   ```bash
   issuerd daemon -c /etc/issuerd/issuerd.toml
   ```
   The default path is `issuerd.toml`, resolved against the daemon's working
   directory. The same flag exists on `issuerd provision` (which reads the
   config only for the storage connection and `issuer_url`). The file format is
   inferred from the extension: `.toml`, `.yaml` / `.yml`, or `.json`
   (an unknown or missing extension is parsed as TOML). The examples in this
   document use TOML.
3. **Environment overrides** — every variable prefixed with `ISSUERD_` is
   merged on top of the file. `__` (double underscore) is the nesting
   separator and variable names are lowercased before mapping:

   | Environment variable | Overrides |
   |---|---|
   | `ISSUERD_PORT=9090` | `port` |
   | `ISSUERD_BIND=127.0.0.1` | `bind` |
   | `ISSUERD_ISSUER_URL=https://idp.example.com` | `issuer_url` |
   | `ISSUERD_REDIS=redis://redis:6379` | `redis` |
   | `ISSUERD_CLUSTER__ENABLED=true` | `cluster.enabled` |
   | `ISSUERD_CLUSTER__JWKS_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS=15` | `cluster.jwks_refresh_interval_secs` |
   | `ISSUERD_CACHE__READ_CACHE_TTL_SECS=0` | `cache.read_cache_ttl_secs` |
   | `ISSUERD_OAUTH__AUTH_CODE_TTL_SECS=60` | `oauth.auth_code_ttl_secs` |
   | `ISSUERD_SMTP__ENABLED=true` / `ISSUERD_SMTP__HOST=mail.example.com` | `smtp.enabled` / `smtp.host` |
   | `ISSUERD_PROXY__TRUST_X_FORWARDED_FOR=false` | `proxy.trust_x_forwarded_for` |

   The shipped cluster stack uses this mechanism for per-node identity
   (`ISSUERD_CLUSTER__NODE_ID` in `docker-compose.cluster.yml`), so the same
   file can be mounted into every node.

> **Warning:** list-valued keys (`cors.allowed_origins`, `proxy.trusted_proxies`,
> `cluster.redis_nodes`) cannot be expressed reliably as a single environment
> variable — set them in the config file (the cluster guide documents
> `cluster.redis_nodes` as TOML-only, see [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)).

Behavioral notes:

- **Missing file is not an error.** If the `-c` path does not exist, it is
  silently skipped and the daemon runs on defaults + environment. A typo in
  the path therefore boots a default server instead of failing — check the
  `loaded configuration` startup log line when in doubt.
- **Invalid content fails the boot.** A file that parses but has the wrong
  type for a key (e.g. `port = "abc"`) aborts startup with
  `config load failed: ...`.
- **Unknown keys are ignored.** Misspelled keys do not cause an error — they
  silently have no effect.
- Environment overrides apply to every subcommand that loads configuration
  (`daemon`, `provision`).

## Minimal configurations

**Development / evaluation (in-memory, zero dependencies):**

```toml
# Everything else takes defaults: in-memory storage, plain HTTP on
# 0.0.0.0:8080, no Redis, no TLS.
issuer_url = "http://localhost:8080"
```

The root `issuerd.toml` in the repository is a working example of this rig.
With in-memory (or JSON-file) storage the `master` realm is bootstrapped
automatically on first start (admin user `admin`/`admin`); see
[getting-started.md](getting-started.md).

**Production (PostgreSQL + Redis, TLS terminated at a proxy):**

```toml
bind       = "0.0.0.0"
port       = 8080
issuer_url = "https://idp.example.com"   # public URL, as clients reach the proxy

redis = "redis://redis:6379"

[storage.postgres]
url = "postgres://issuerd:SECRET@postgres:5432/issuerd"

[proxy]
trusted_proxies = ["10.0.0.0/8"]   # your load balancer / ingress subnet
```

Modeled on `examples/issuerd.demo.toml` (the demo stack's production-shaped
config). With PostgreSQL, automatic master-realm bootstrap does **not** run —
define `master` in a provision file (see `examples/provision.demo.yaml` and
[provisioning.md](provisioning.md)) or create it via the Admin API.

## Root keys

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bind` | string (IP literal) | `"0.0.0.0"` | Interface to bind. Parsed as an IP literal, so IPv6 (`"::"`, `"::1"`) works. A name or invalid literal fails the boot. |
| `port` | integer | `8080` | TCP port for HTTP (or HTTPS when `[tls]` is set). |
| `issuer_url` | string (URL) | `"http://localhost:8080"` | Public base URL of this server. See the deep-dive below. |
| `redis` | string (URL), optional | unset | Single Redis node, e.g. `"redis://localhost:6379"` (`rediss://` for TLS). Unset ⇒ in-process ephemeral cache. Overridden by `cluster.redis_nodes` when that list is non-empty. |
| `provision` | path, optional | unset | Provision file (YAML/TOML/JSON by extension) applied **exactly once** at startup — a marker is claimed in storage before applying, so restarts and concurrent first boots skip it. Relative paths resolve against the working directory. A missing/unreadable file logs an error and boot continues. Format: [provisioning.md](provisioning.md). |

### About `issuer_url`

This is the most consequential value in the file:

- It must be an **absolute `http(s)` URL** — anything else aborts the boot
  with `issuer_url must be an absolute http(s) URL`.
- It is baked into every token's `iss` claim and into the OIDC discovery
  document as `{issuer_url}/realms/{realm-name}` (the realm **name**, never
  the internal UUID). Clients validate `iss` strictly, so `issuer_url` must be
  exactly how browsers and applications reach the server — scheme, host, and
  port included. If you terminate TLS at a proxy, `issuer_url` keeps the
  public `https` scheme even though the daemon itself serves plain HTTP.
- In a cluster it must be the load balancer's URL and **identical on every
  node** (see [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)).
- Its scheme drives the `Secure` attribute on every authentication cookie the
  server sets (SSO session `issuerd_session_{realm-id}`, remember-me
  `issuerd_remember_{realm-id}`, the `issuerd_flow_{id}` flow correlation
  cookie, and the logout clears): `https` ⇒ all cookies carry `Secure`;
  `http` ⇒ they do not, so plain-HTTP development rigs keep working. The flag
  is derived from this config value, never from the request.
- Changing it later effectively changes every realm's issuer: outstanding
  tokens, sessions, and stored client configurations that reference the old
  issuer stop validating, and users must re-authenticate. Treat it as
  permanent once realms are in use.

## [storage]

The persistent store for realms, users, clients, sessions, signing keys, and
events. Exactly one variant is active; the default is in-memory (no section at
all).

| Variant | TOML shape | Durability | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-memory (default) | *(omit the section)* | None — empty on every boot | Development, tests, demos |
| PostgreSQL | `[storage.postgres]` + `url` | Durable, shared between nodes | Production, clusters |
| JSON file | `[storage.json_file]` + `path` | Durable, single node | Manual testing, small single-node rigs |

```toml
# PostgreSQL — recommended for production.
[storage.postgres]
url = "postgres://issuerd:issuerd_secret@localhost:5432/issuerd"
```

- Schema migrations are **applied automatically at boot** (and by the
  `issuerd provision` subcommand), so upgrades only require starting the new
  binary. See [backup-and-upgrade.md](backup-and-upgrade.md).
- This is the only backend that supports multi-node clusters (see
  [[cluster]](#cluster)) — in a cluster, token issuance is shared between
  nodes via the shared `signing_keys` table.

```toml
# JSON file — full-state snapshot persistence.
[storage.json_file]
path = "issuerd-data.json"
```

- The entire state is loaded from the file at boot and **rewritten in full on
  every write**, serialized through a global lock — correct but slow, so it is
  meant for manual testing and single-node rigs, not production traffic.
- Like in-memory, it triggers the automatic master-realm bootstrap on first
  start.

> **Note:** with in-memory storage, JWT signing keys are generated per boot,
> so all outstanding tokens are invalidated by a restart. The JSON-file
> backend persists them in its snapshot; with PostgreSQL they live in the
> shared `signing_keys` table — both survive restarts and redeploys.

## [tls]

Optional. When present, the daemon itself serves HTTPS via rustls (TLS 1.2+);
when absent, it serves plain HTTP.

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cert_path` | path (PEM) | Certificate chain file. |
| `key_path` | path (PEM) | Private key file. |

```toml
[tls]
cert_path = "certs/idp.example.com.crt"
key_path  = "certs/idp.example.com.key"
```

Both files are read at startup; unreadable or unparsable PEM fails the boot.
Paths are resolved against the working directory.

In most production deployments it is simpler to **terminate TLS at a reverse
proxy or load balancer** and run Issuerd on plain HTTP behind it. If you do,
remember that `issuer_url` still uses the public `https` scheme, and configure
[[proxy]](#proxy) so the daemon sees real client IPs. See
[deployment.md](deployment.md) and [security.md](security.md).

## [logging]

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | string | `"pretty"` |
| `level` | string | `"info"` |

`level` is one of `error`, `warn` (alias `warning`), `info`, `debug`,
`trace`. `format` is
`pretty` (human-readable console text) or `json` (one JSON object per event,
for log shippers). Unparsable values fall back to the defaults with a WARN at
startup.

The effective log level is resolved with this precedence:

1. **`RUST_LOG`** — when set, it wins completely. Any standard `tracing`
   EnvFilter directive string is accepted, e.g.
   `RUST_LOG=issuerd_server=debug,issuerd_storage=warn` for per-crate control.
2. **`-v` / `-q` CLI flags** (global, repeatable): default is `info`;
   `-v` → `debug`; `-vv` (or more) → `trace`; `-q` → `warn`; `-qq` (or
   more) → `error`.
   ```bash
   issuerd -v daemon -c issuerd.toml
   ```
3. **`[logging].level`** from the config file.

The flag/config level is applied to Issuerd's own crates (`issuerd`,
`issuerd_server`, `issuerd_core`, `issuerd_auth_flow`, `issuerd_protocol`, `issuerd_token`,
`issuerd_storage`, `issuerd_cluster`, `issuerd_admin_api`, `issuerd_federation`); use `RUST_LOG`
to also tune dependencies such as `sqlx` or `tower`.

Notes on output:

- `format` applies to the **console** output only. On Linux under systemd
  (when `JOURNAL_STREAM` is set) logs go to **journald** in its own
  structured format instead; if journald initialization fails, the daemon
  prints a notice to stderr and falls back to console formatting.
- ANSI colors are emitted only when stdout is a terminal, so piped and
  container logs stay free of escape codes. (On Windows the console ANSI
  support is enabled explicitly at startup.) The JSON formatter never emits
  ANSI.
- Records from dependencies that log through the `log` facade (ldap3, redis,
  reqwest, rustls, sqlx, …) are bridged into tracing and filtered by the
  same directives.

See [monitoring.md](monitoring.md) for metrics and health endpoints.

## [web_ui]

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` |

> **Warning:** this key is currently **parsed but not consulted**. The
> consoles are served whenever the SPA assets were embedded
> into the binary at build time — release builds embed them — and there is no
> runtime switch to turn them off.

The served surfaces are the admin console at `/admin/console` and the account
console at `/realms/{realm}/account`. If the assets were not embedded (a
debug build without `webclientsrc/dist`), those paths answer `404`; the Admin
API under `/admin/...` and all protocol endpoints are unaffected either way.

## [proxy]

Controls how the daemon determines the **real client IP** when it sits behind
a reverse proxy or load balancer.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trusted_proxies` | list of strings | `[]` | IPs or CIDR ranges of your proxies, e.g. `["10.0.0.1", "172.32.0.0/24"]`. Forwarded headers are honored **only** when the direct peer matches an entry. |
| `trust_x_forwarded_for` | boolean | `true` | Honor `X-Forwarded-For` from trusted peers. Within the header, the rightmost entry that is not itself a trusted proxy wins (entries to its right were appended by proxies you trust). |
| `trust_x_real_ip` | boolean | `true` | Honor `X-Real-IP` from trusted peers (used when XFF yields nothing). |

```toml
[proxy]
trusted_proxies = ["172.32.0.0/24"]   # subnet of your LB / ingress
trust_x_forwarded_for = true
trust_x_real_ip = true
```

With the default empty `trusted_proxies`, the trust flags are inert: every
forwarded header is ignored and the direct peer's address is used — the safe
behavior when no proxy is in front.

> **Warning:** getting this wrong breaks brute-force protection. Login-failure
> counters are keyed by client IP (`login-failure:{realm}:{username}:{ip}`).
> If `trusted_proxies` is empty behind an LB, every user appears to come from
> the LB's address, so per-IP lockouts aggregate all users into one bucket; if
> you trusted headers from untrusted peers, attackers could spoof their IP to
> dodge lockout. List exactly the proxy subnets. See [security.md](security.md)
> and the LB requirements in [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md).

## [cors]

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_origins` | list of strings | `[]` |

Cross-origin browser access is **fully locked down by default**: with an empty
list the server emits no CORS headers, so browsers block all cross-origin
calls. The embedded admin and account consoles are same-origin and need no
CORS; non-browser clients (service-to-service) are unaffected.

Add exact origins — scheme + host + port, no wildcards — only for browser
applications hosted on other origins:

```toml
[cors]
allowed_origins = ["https://app.example.com", "https://spa.internal:3443"]
```

Allowed methods are `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS` and allowed
headers are `Authorization` and `Content-Type`. Entries that are not valid
header values are skipped with a startup warning. Cross-origin applications
also need the origin in their client registration (`web_origins`); see
[client-integration.md](client-integration.md).

## [cluster]

Opt-in multi-node mode. The full guide, including the load balancer contract
and the Docker Compose demo, is [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md); this section
is the key reference.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enforce the multi-node contract at boot (below). |
| `node_id` | string, optional | `$HOSTNAME`, else a random id | Stable node identity, used for log correlation only. |
| `redis_nodes` | list of strings | `[]` | Redis Cluster node URLs, e.g. `["redis://r1:6379", "redis://r2:6379"]`. When non-empty, **overrides** the single-node `redis` URL. |
| `jwks_refresh_interval_secs` | integer | `30` | How often the node re-reads the shared signing-key set from storage and reloads its keystore + JWKS snapshot, so keys rotated by peers propagate without a restart. |

```toml
[cluster]
enabled = true
node_id = "node-1"
redis_nodes = []
jwks_refresh_interval_secs = 30
```

**Boot-time contract:** with `enabled = true`, boot **fails** unless storage
is PostgreSQL **and** a Redis cache is configured (`redis` or
`cluster.redis_nodes`), with the error
``cluster.enabled requires PostgreSQL storage and a Redis cache (set `redis` or `cluster.redis_nodes`)``.
This refuses
split-brain configurations where, for example, an authorization code issued on
node A could not be redeemed on node B. The JWKS refresh task only runs with
PostgreSQL storage — the other backends are single-node by definition and have
nothing to poll.

## [cache]

One knob governs every read-model cache on the token hot paths.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read_cache_ttl_secs` | integer | `60` | TTL in seconds of every read-model cache entry. `0` disables all read-model caches (every lookup hits storage — pre-cache behavior). |

The read model keeps per-request work off the database: session-validity
snapshots behind `userinfo`/`introspect`, the realm-by-name resolution cache,
the claims read model (per-user claims bundles, the realm role/scope catalog,
client bundles and default scope assignments), and the rendered
userinfo/discovery response caches.

Mutations through the Admin API and the server's own write paths invalidate
precisely — single-entity changes delete their keys, realm-wide definition
changes bump an epoch — so committed writes are visible immediately. A write
that bypasses both (e.g. a direct database edit) stays hidden for at most
`read_cache_ttl_secs`: the consciously accepted bounded-staleness window, the
same class as Keycloak's Infinispan propagation. Set `0` for pure-DB behavior
(useful in tests, or when debugging unexpected staleness).

## [oauth]

OAuth/OIDC protocol tuning. The whole section is optional.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth_code_ttl_secs` | integer | `600` | Lifetime of an authorization code: how long the client has to redeem it at the token endpoint. Accepted range **10–600** seconds; an out-of-range value aborts the boot with a clear error (no silent clamping). |

```toml
[oauth]
auth_code_ttl_secs = 600
```

The default of 600 s (10 minutes) is the common interoperable value (Keycloak
uses the same) and matches every pre-existing deployment — codes minted before
an upgrade are unaffected (they keep the TTL they were written with).

**Per-realm override.** The realm attribute `auth_code_ttl_secs` (set via the
realm representation's `attributes` map, the provision YAML `attributes`
block, or the admin console's realm attributes) overrides the server value
for one realm. It must parse as an integer within the same 10–600 bounds; an
absent, malformed, or out-of-range attribute is ignored and the server-wide
value applies.

**FAPI 2.0 note.** A FAPI 2.0 high-assurance profile requires authorization
codes to expire within **60 seconds** — set `auth_code_ttl_secs = 60` (globally
or per realm) when assembling such a profile. This exposes only the TTL knob a
profile needs; full FAPI 2.0 conformance (message signing beyond the
already-implemented JARM, mTLS sender-constrained tokens) remains out of
scope.

## [crypto.key_encryption]

Envelope encryption for the cluster-wide JWT **signing keys at rest**
(PostgreSQL storage only). Without this section the `signing_keys` table holds
private key material (PKCS#8 DER) in plaintext, and a database dump yields
keys that can mint tokens for every realm. With it, `PostgresStorage`
encrypts each key with a config-provided **Key Encryption Key (KEK)** before
writing (AES-256-GCM, random per-key nonce), and the table only ever holds
ciphertext. Decryption is transparent on read; the KEK is never stored in the
database.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `key_id` | string | — | Identifier of the active KEK, persisted on every encrypted row (`kek_kid`) so a later rotation knows which KEK must decrypt it. Non-empty, ≤ 64 chars. |
| `key_base64` | string | — | Base64-encoded 32-byte KEK (AES-256). Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Prefer the env var over committing it to the file. |
| `previous_keys` | array of tables | `[]` | Retired KEKs (`key_id` + `key_base64`) accepted for **decryption only** — the KEK-rotation window. File-only setting (env vars cannot index into arrays). |

```toml
[crypto.key_encryption]
key_id     = "kek-2026-01"
key_base64 = "…"   # prefer ISSUERD_CRYPTO__KEY_ENCRYPTION__KEY_BASE64

# KEK rotation window: the retired KEK stays until every row is re-encrypted.
# [[crypto.key_encryption.previous_keys]]
# key_id     = "kek-2025-01"
# key_base64 = "…"
```

Environment equivalents: `ISSUERD_CRYPTO__KEY_ENCRYPTION__KEY_ID` and
`ISSUERD_CRYPTO__KEY_ENCRYPTION__KEY_BASE64`.

**Behavior contract:**

- **Absent section** = current plaintext behavior, plus a startup WARN on
  PostgreSQL deployments (`signing keys are stored in PLAINTEXT …`). Existing
  deployments boot unchanged.
- **First enablement / rotation**: at boot — after migrations, before the
  keystore loads — a sweep re-encrypts every row that is still plaintext or
  was encrypted under a non-active KEK (`re-encrypted signing keys at rest`
  log line with the row count). New keys and every admin rotation
  (`keys/rotate`, `keys/{kid}/disable`) are written encrypted from the start.
- **Fail closed**: a boot whose KEK cannot decrypt a row (wrong key bytes,
  unknown `kek_kid`) aborts with a `signing-key encryption error` naming the
  row `kid` and `kek_kid`. There is never a plaintext fallback. An invalid
  section (bad base64, key not exactly 32 bytes, empty/duplicate `key_id`)
  also aborts boot.
- **Mixed-version clusters**: rows written by a KEK-enabled binary have
  `private_der = NULL`, which a pre-encryption binary cannot read. Enable the
  section only after **every** node runs the new version, and give all nodes
  the identical section (see [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)).
- **KEK rotation**: set the new `key_id`/`key_base64`, move the old pair into
  `previous_keys`, roll the config to all nodes and restart — each boot sweep
  re-encrypts the rows under the new KEK. Verify with
  `SELECT DISTINCT kek_kid FROM signing_keys`, then drop the `previous_keys`
  entry. Full procedure in [backup-and-upgrade.md](backup-and-upgrade.md).
- **PostgreSQL-only**: with the in-memory or JSON-file backends the section is
  ignored (boot WARN) — protect JSON snapshots at the filesystem level; they
  hold plaintext keys by design (dev/manual-test backend).
- **Memory-hygiene limits**: decrypted key material is zeroized on drop
  (`StoredSigningKey`, the keystore's retired keys, and transient buffers).
  What cannot be zeroized is the resident signing key while it is in use and
  the internal copies `ring`/`jsonwebtoken` make per sign call — the guarantee
  is "no additional long-lived plaintext copies beyond the resident key".

## [themes]

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `dir` | path | `"themes"` |

Root directory of login-theme assets, one subdirectory per theme. Relative
paths resolve against the daemon's working directory. The repository ships the
built-in default theme at `themes/issuerd`.

- A realm's `login_theme` setting (realm configuration in the admin console /
  Admin API — see [administration.md](administration.md)) selects the
  directory; assets are served at `/realms/{realm}/theme/{path}`.
- Fallback is per file: anything a custom theme does not provide is served
  from the built-in `issuerd` theme, so a custom theme only ships the files
  it overrides (e.g. just `login.css`).
- A theme may also carry `messages_{locale}.json` bundles that merge over the
  built-in login/email translations.

## [smtp]

Email is used for address verification, password reset, execute-actions
emails, and the optional email-code login flow.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master switch. |
| `host` | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | SMTP server hostname/IP. |
| `port` | integer | `25` | SMTP server port. |
| `from` | string | `"issuerd@localhost"` | Envelope/header sender address. |
| `from_display` | string, optional | unset | Sender display name. |
| `reply_to` | string, optional | unset | `Reply-To` address. |
| `starttls` | boolean | `false` | Upgrade the connection with STARTTLS. |
| `ssl` | boolean | `false` | Implicit TLS (SMTPS) from connect. |
| `username` / `password` | string, optional | unset | SMTP AUTH credentials. |

```toml
[smtp]
enabled      = true
host         = "mail.example.com"
port         = 587
from         = "no-reply@example.com"
from_display = "Example ID"
starttls     = true
username     = "issuerd"
password     = "SECRET"   # prefer ISSUERD_SMTP__PASSWORD over committing this
```

**Disabled-by-default semantics:** with `enabled = false` the server wires a
no-op sender, and any flow that needs to send mail **fails loudly** with
`SMTP is not configured: set [smtp] enabled = true ...` rather than silently
dropping the message. Do not turn on realm email features (email verification,
reset credentials, email-code login) before SMTP works, or users will hit that
error at login/registration.

**Per-realm overrides.** Following the Keycloak model, a realm can override
every SMTP value except `enabled` (which stays a global gate) through realm
attributes named `smtpServer.*`, set via the Admin API / console (see
[administration.md](administration.md)):

| Realm attribute | Overrides config key |
|---|---|
| `smtpServer.host` | `host` |
| `smtpServer.port` | `port` |
| `smtpServer.from` | `from` |
| `smtpServer.fromDisplayName` | `from_display` |
| `smtpServer.replyTo` | `reply_to` |
| `smtpServer.starttls` | `starttls` (`"true"` / anything-else) |
| `smtpServer.ssl` | `ssl` |
| `smtpServer.user` | `username` |
| `smtpServer.password` | `password` |

Note the attribute names are camelCase and the credential attribute is `user`,
not `username`. Realms without these attributes use the global config.

## Token signing algorithm

There is no config-file key for the token-signing algorithm — it is an
operational property of the shared signing-key set plus one realm attribute.

- **Server default: EdDSA (Ed25519).** On first boot (empty `signing_keys`
  table) the server generates and persists an **EdDSA** key
  (`bootstrap_crypto_provider` in `crates/issuerd-server/src/state.rs`), and
  realms without an explicit setting sign with the newest active key of the
  server-default algorithm (`CryptoConfig::default_alg`). Fresh deployments
  therefore issue EdDSA tokens out of the box — no RSA key is ever generated
  unless an operator opts in.
- **Per-realm override.** The realm attribute `default_signature_algorithm`
  (set via the realm representation's `attributes` map, the provision YAML
  `attributes` block, or the admin console's Tokens/Keys pages) pins a realm
  to one of `RS256`/`RS384`/`RS512`, `ES256`/`ES384`/`ES512`, `EdDSA`.
  Symmetric `HS*` values are **not applicable to realm token signing** and are
  ignored (an HMAC key publishes no usable public verification material), as
  are unknown values. If no active key of the chosen algorithm exists,
  issuance falls back to the newest active key overall — rotate a key of that
  algorithm first (`POST /admin/realms/{realm}/keys/rotate`).
- **RS256 as an explicit compatibility choice.** RSA remains fully supported
  for clients that cannot consume Ed25519/ECDSA keys: rotate in an RSA key
  (`{"algorithm": "RS256", "key_size": 2048}`) and pin the realm attribute to
  `RS256`. Note the `rsa` crate is used **only for key generation** (signing
  and verification go through `ring`), which is why `RUSTSEC-2023-0071`
  (Marvin) is ignored in `.cargo/audit.toml` / `deny.toml` — issuerd performs
  no RSA decryption, so the padding oracle is unreachable.
- **Upgrading existing deployments.** Stored keys are never touched by an
  upgrade: an existing RS256-only key set keeps signing RS256 for
  un-configured realms (the EdDSA default finds no matching key and falls
  back). Rotating in an EdDSA key switches un-configured realms to EdDSA —
  pin `default_signature_algorithm=RS256` on realms that must stay on RSA
  before doing so.

## Complete annotated example

This is `examples/issuerd.example.toml` with every key explained. It is a
**reference, not a runnable default** — it assumes PostgreSQL, Redis, and
certificate files exist. Generate a fresh copy with the CLI (next section).

```toml
# ---- Root keys -------------------------------------------------------------
bind       = "0.0.0.0"                      # listen interface (IP literal; "::" for IPv6 any)

## Generating the example config

The binary writes a fully populated example itself — the committed
`examples/issuerd.example.toml` is produced the same way, and a unit test in
`crates/issuerd-server/src/config.rs` verifies it stays loadable:

```bash
# TOML (extension chooses the format: .toml, .yaml/.yml, .json)
issuerd example server-config -o my.toml

# YAML
issuerd example server-config -o my.yaml

# The provision file has a generator too (see provisioning.md)
issuerd example provision-config -o provision.yaml
```

The generated file enables TLS and PostgreSQL with the same placeholder values
shown above — treat it as a checklist to edit, not as-is configuration. The
`-o` default is `examples/issuerd.example.toml` (the repo's committed
reference), so pass an explicit output path.
