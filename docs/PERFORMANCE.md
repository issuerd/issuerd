# Issuerd Performance

Measured performance of Issuerd against **Keycloak 26.7** under identical container
resource limits, plus CPU/RAM/disk/log sizing data. **Issuerd is faster than
Keycloak 26.7 in every measured scenario** — up to 7.8× the throughput, with lower
p99 latency in every headline scenario (§2; the agentic-workload nuances are in §4) —
while idling on ~6× less memory and shipping an 8.7× smaller image. **Every number
on this page comes from a real run** of the benchmark stack in `tests/perf/` on the
hardware described below — nothing is estimated unless it is explicitly marked
*(extrapolated)*.

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Host | Intel Core Ultra 7 265K (20 cores), 128 GiB RAM, Windows 11 |
| Container runtime | Docker Desktop 29.6.2 (WSL2 VM: 16 vCPU / ~101 GiB) |
| Issuerd | `issuerd:perf` — local release build from this repo (distroless image) |
| Keycloak | `keycloak-optimized:26.7.4` — **optimized production build** of `keycloak/keycloak:26.7.4` (`kc.sh build` at image-build time, `start --optimized` at runtime; `tests/perf/keycloak/Dockerfile`) + PostgreSQL 15 backend, realm import with 1,000 users |
| CIBA helper | `ad-simulator` (`python:3.12-alpine`, 0.25 CPU / 128 MiB) — approves Keycloak CIBA requests via KC's auth-channel callback (§1.4) |
| Database (both) | `postgres:15-alpine`, one dedicated instance per server |
| Load generator | `grafana/k6:2.1.0`, running **inside** the isolated network (no host-network noise) |

Topology: one Docker bridge network `172.34.0.0/24` with `internal: true` — **no
internet access in either direction, nothing is published**. Both servers serve plain
HTTP inside the network (TLS is normally terminated at the edge; both sides are
measured identically).

### 1.2 Resource tiers

App containers are pinned with Docker `deploy.resources.limits`; PostgreSQL and k6 are
fixed across tiers.

| Tier | App container | PostgreSQL | k6 |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----|
| small | 1 CPU / 512 MiB | 2 CPU / 2 GiB | 4 CPU / 2 GiB |
| medium | 2 CPU / 1 GiB | 2 CPU / 2 GiB | 4 CPU / 2 GiB |
| large | 4 CPU / 2 GiB | 2 CPU / 2 GiB | 4 CPU / 2 GiB |

### 1.3 Fair-comparison rules

- Same machine, same tiers, same k6 scripts, same scenario mix, runs executed
  sequentially (the idle server adds no measurable load: <0.1% CPU).
- Equal functional setup: realm `perf`, confidential + public clients, PKCE (S256) on
  the auth-code flow, password users provisioned in bulk. Password hashing is each
  server's **out-of-box default** — Argon2id on **both** sides since Keycloak 25,
  verified from the stored credential rows: Keycloak 26.7 Argon2id m=7,168 KiB,
  t=5, p=1; Issuerd Argon2id m=19,456 KiB, t=2, p=1 (the Rust `argon2` crate
  default). Neither side was tuned.
- Keycloak 26 persists **user sessions in the database by default** (the
  persistent-user-sessions feature), so both servers now pay per-login DB writes.
  Keycloak's realm still has **event persistence off** (its default); Issuerd
  persists login + admin events by default — Issuerd pays a per-login event write
  that Keycloak skips.
- Keycloak 26.7 runs its **optimized production build** — `kc.sh build` at
  image-build time, `start --optimized` at runtime, the documented production
  container shape (not the `start-dev` quickstart), with the public base URL
  pinned via hostname v2 (`--hostname=http://keycloak:8080`).
- **DPoP** is supported and on by default since Keycloak 26.4: KC binds a token
  whenever a valid proof is presented, exactly like Issuerd. No client attribute
  was set (forcing `dpop.bound.access.tokens` would break the proof-less
  scenarios that share the same client).
- **CIBA** (poll mode) is supported and on by default in Keycloak 26. KC's
  built-in HTTP auth channel is pointed at the `ad-simulator` container, which
  approves every backchannel request through KC's own callback endpoint. The k6
  script waits a **modeled 200 ms device-approval latency** before its first
  poll (polling earlier always loses the race against KC's auth-session commit
  and lands on the `slow_down` interval path); Issuerd's approval is an
  in-loop SSO-cookie call instead (§1.4). Both are disclosed in the numbers.
- **Introspection** on Keycloak 25+ requires the calling client in the token's
  `aud`; the imported realm adds an `audience-self` protocol mapper to the
  confidential client (no equivalent needed on Issuerd).
- All reported runs had **0% scenario errors** (k6 `errors` rate), except the
  bulk-provisioning scenario where 409-conflict skips are by design (§3 note) and
  one small-tier DPoP run with 0.6% transient transport failures (§4 note).

### 1.4 Scenarios and load profiles

| Scenario | What one iteration does | Default load |
|---|---|---|
| `discovery` | `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` | 50&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `client_credentials` | `POST /token` (grant_type=client_credentials) | 50&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `password_grant` | `POST /token` (ROPC), distinct user per request from a pool | 20&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `userinfo` | `GET /userinfo` with a Bearer token | 100&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `introspect` | `POST /token/introspect` (confidential client) | 50&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `auth_code_flow` | full browser-less login: `GET /authorize` → login POST → code+PKCE token exchange (3 requests) | 15&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `dpop` | two concurrent sub-scenarios (30 VU each): token request with a fresh ES256 DPoP proof, and DPoP-bound `userinfo` (proof carries `ath`, single-use `jti`) | 2×30&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `ciba` | full CIBA cycle: `bc-auth` → user approve → token poll. Issuerd: 3 measured requests, approval via SSO-cookie `ext/ciba/approve`. Keycloak: 2 measured requests, approval out-of-band via the ad-simulator after a modeled 200 ms device-approval latency | 10&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |
| `admin_users` | Admin-API user creation with password (provisioning rate) | 10&nbsp;VU,&nbsp;60&nbsp;s |

## 2. Headline results — medium tier (2 CPU / 1 GiB)

Throughput (requests/second, higher is better):

| Scenario | Issuerd | Keycloak 26.7 | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| discovery | **61,560** | 7,872 | 7.8× |
| client_credentials | **1,630** | 756 | 2.2× |
| password_grant (login) | **129** | 59.5 | 2.2× |
| userinfo | **13,989** | 8,567 | 1.6× |
| introspect | **13,107** | 5,966 | 2.2× |
| auth_code_flow | **309** (103 logins/s) | 168 (55.8 logins/s) | 1.8× |
| admin_users (provisioning) | **133** | 56 | 2.4× |

p99 latency (ms, lower is better — Issuerd is lower in **every** scenario):

| Scenario | Issuerd p99 | Keycloak 26.7 p99 |
|---|---:|---:|
| discovery | **2.2** | 86.9 |
| client_credentials | **37.5** | 192.8 |
| password_grant | **218.9** | 437.4 |
| userinfo | **12.1** | 91.1 |
| introspect | **7.1** | 84.8 |
| auth_code_flow | **118.8** | 337.6 |
| admin_users | **107.4** | 233.7 |

![Throughput by scenario, medium tier](images/perf/throughput_vs_keycloak_medium.png)
![p99 latency by scenario, medium tier](images/perf/p99_vs_keycloak_medium.png)

Reading the table honestly:

- Both servers hash passwords with Argon2id by default (parameters in §1.3).
  Single-VU latency probes: Issuerd 21.8 ms avg vs Keycloak 41.6 ms avg on
  password_grant.
- **Logins and token issuance are CPU-bound on the password hasher / signer** —
  this is where Issuerd's async architecture still wins outright: 2.2× the login
  throughput with half the p99, and it keeps winning as CPU is added (§3).
- **Session-checked reads (`userinfo`/`introspect`): Issuerd wins both at every
  tier.** Medium tier: `userinfo` 13,989 vs 8,567 rps (1.6×), `introspect`
  13,107 vs 5,966 rps (2.2×) — with p99 12.1 ms vs 91.1 ms and 7.1 ms vs 84.8 ms.
  Large tier: `userinfo` 26,293 vs 19,642 rps, `introspect` 24,197 vs 12,493 rps.
  Issuerd serves the whole read path from an Infinispan-style read model —
  session validity, the user record, roles/groups, client and scope
  configuration, and the fully rendered `userinfo` body are all cached with
  synchronous, epoch/generation-validated invalidation — and its PostgreSQL
  averages ~1% CPU under large-tier `userinfo` (1.1%), close to Keycloak's
  (0.3%). The design choice stands: revoke a session (or change a role) and it
  takes effect **immediately** on every node, no invalidation-latency window.
- Keycloak's medians on cached reads are excellent (p50 0.7–1.5 ms) but its tail
  is not: at small/medium its p95 jumps to 79–99 ms, and even at the large tier
  p99 stays 62–70 ms on paths whose p95 has dropped to ~3–5 ms — a GC-pause-shaped
  tail. Issuerd's p50→p99 spread stays tight (e.g. discovery 0.7 ms → 2.2 ms).

## 3. Tier scaling (1 → 2 → 4 CPU)

Requests/second:

| Scenario | server | small | medium | large |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| discovery | Issuerd | **40,588** | **61,560** | **99,008** |
| | Keycloak | 1,756 | 7,872 | 21,013 |
| client_credentials | Issuerd | **860** | **1,630** | **3,387** |
| | Keycloak | 205 | 756 | 1,693 |
| password_grant | Issuerd | **73.5** | **129** | **222** |
| | Keycloak | 24.3 | 59.5 | 104.1 |
| userinfo | Issuerd | **7,307** | **13,989** | **26,293** |
| | Keycloak | 2,964 | 8,567 | 19,642 |
| introspect | Issuerd | **6,829** | **13,107** | **24,197** |
| | Keycloak | 2,368 | 5,966 | 12,493 |
| auth_code_flow | Issuerd | **182** | **309** | **532** |
| | Keycloak | 59.2 | 168 | 289 |

![Issuerd throughput vs tier](images/perf/issuerd_scaling.png)
![Throughput, small tier](images/perf/throughput_vs_keycloak_small.png)
![p99, small tier](images/perf/p99_vs_keycloak_small.png)
![Throughput, large tier](images/perf/throughput_vs_keycloak_large.png)
![p99, large tier](images/perf/p99_vs_keycloak_large.png)

Observations:

- **Issuerd scales almost linearly on CPU-bound paths**: client_credentials
  860 → 3,387 (3.9× for 4× the CPU), password_grant 73.5 → 222 (3.0×),
  auth_code_flow 182 → 532 (2.9×).
- **`userinfo` and `introspect` scale near-linearly and win every tier**
  (userinfo 7,307 → 26,293, introspect 6,829 → 24,197 — ≈1.8–1.9× per CPU
  doubling): app-CPU-bound (peak ≈410% of the 400% large-tier cap) with
  PostgreSQL averaging ≈1%, beating Keycloak's large-tier throughput 1.3×/1.9×
  with far better tails (userinfo p99 7.5 ms vs 70.0 ms, introspect 4.3 ms vs
  65.4 ms at the large tier).
- `discovery` serves a pre-rendered, content-validated document and reaches
  **99,008 rps** at the large tier (p99 1.6 ms) — 4.7× Keycloak's 21,013, a
  number Issuerd already exceeds at the small tier. Scaling flattens (2.4× for
  4× CPU) because the fixed 50 k6 VUs, not the server, become the limit
  (large-tier p50 is 0.4 ms).
- Keycloak 26.7 scales well too — discovery 1,756 → 21,013, password_grant
  24.3 → 104.1 — but starts lower everywhere.
- Keycloak boots and serves at the small tier (1 CPU / 512 MiB), but login p99 is
  2.5 s and auth-code p99 is 1.6 s there; Issuerd's worst small-tier p99 is
  326 ms (password_grant, Argon2id on 1 CPU).
- `admin_users` is compared at the medium tier only: the small/large runs reused
  the deterministic user-name space on the same database, so most requests were
  409-conflict skips rather than provisioning, and are excluded from the
  comparison. The medium rows above ran against a fresh namespace for both
  servers.

## 4. Agentic workloads (DPoP / CIBA)

Issuerd implements **DPoP (RFC 9449)** and **CIBA (poll mode)** — the two flows
that matter most for agentic IAM (proof-of-possession tokens for tool/API calls,
and decoupled user approval for long-running agent actions). Keycloak 26.7
supports both (DPoP on by default since 26.4; CIBA poll mode via its HTTP auth
channel), so this section is a head-to-head.

| Scenario | server | small | medium | large | p99 (medium) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `dpop` (proof-carrying requests/s) | Issuerd | **2,094** | **4,262** | **7,649** | **74.9 ms** |
| | Keycloak | 532 | 1,434 | 3,151 | 110.6 ms |
| `ciba` (full cycles/s) | Issuerd | **188** | **285** | **446** | 24.5 ms |
| | Keycloak | 46.0 | 47.2 | 47.6 | **10.1 ms** |

![Agentic workloads, medium tier](images/perf/agentic_medium.png)

- **DPoP**: each iteration mints a fresh ES256 proof in k6 via WebCrypto; the
  server verifies the signature, the single-use `jti`, and (on userinfo) the
  `ath` token binding. Issuerd leads 2.4–3.9× depending on tier — ES256
  verification is pure CPU, and Issuerd's lead tracks its general CPU
  efficiency. Across the three tiers the campaign pushed **840k DPoP
  proof-carrying requests through Issuerd and 307k through Keycloak**.
- **CIBA**: the cycle shapes differ by design (§1.4): Issuerd's cycle is three
  measured requests (bc-auth → SSO-cookie approve → poll), Keycloak's is two
  (bc-auth → poll) with the approval performed out-of-band by the ad-simulator
  container and a modeled 200 ms device-approval latency before the first poll.
  Two honest ways to read it:
  - *Cycle rate at 10 VUs*: Issuerd completes **285 cycles/s** at the medium
    tier and scales with CPU (188 → 446); Keycloak sits flat at **≈47 cycles/s**
    at every tier — bounded by the harness (10 VUs × 200 ms modeled latency ≈
    50 cycles/s ceiling), not by server capacity: Keycloak's app CPU averaged
    only 29–36% of one core during CIBA, so its real ceiling is far above what
    this harness can express.
  - *Per-request latency*: both servers are excellent — Keycloak's p99 is
    10.1 ms vs Issuerd's 24.5 ms at the medium tier. Note Issuerd's measured
    requests include the approval write path itself (browser-session
    authentication + approval + audit event), which the Keycloak numbers
    delegate to the helper container.
  - Load on the database: Issuerd's CIBA is its heaviest DB workload —
    PostgreSQL averaged ~55% of one core at the medium tier and ~99% of one core
    (of its 2-core allowance) at the large tier, without saturating.
- Across the campaign Issuerd completed **46.6k full CIBA cycles** and Keycloak
  **8.5k**, all with 0 errors. The one blemish anywhere in the campaign:
  Issuerd's small-tier DPoP run recorded 0.61% transient transport failures
  (769 of 125,718 requests; the scenario-level `errors` rate stayed 0) — a
  one-off at the 1-CPU tier, not a systematic limit.

## 5. Resource usage: CPU, RAM, images

**Memory.** Issuerd's working set is an order of magnitude smaller and flat across
scenarios — no GC, no heap to tune:

| | idle RSS | peak under load (medium tier) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Issuerd app | 88 MiB | 74–158 MiB across all 9 scenarios |
| Keycloak 26.7 app | 533 MiB | 696–818 MiB |

![Peak memory under load](images/perf/memory_medium.png)

At the large tier the worst peaks were 271 MiB (Issuerd, bulk provisioning) vs
1,255 MiB (Keycloak, auth_code_flow) against a 2 GiB limit.

**CPU.** Under load both servers saturate their container CPU cap on CPU-bound
scenarios (Issuerd averages 175–191% and peaks ≈190–205% of its 200% medium cap
on discovery, userinfo and introspect; Keycloak peaks ≈200–210%). CIBA is the
only scenario that saturates neither (§4). No measured read path is DB-bound:
Issuerd's PostgreSQL averages ≤1.2% CPU under `discovery`, `userinfo` and
`introspect` at every tier (Keycloak's: ≤0.5%), and remaining DB work is on the
write paths — logins, CIBA cycles and provisioning.

**Image footprint.** 29.5 MiB vs 258.1 MiB **compressed** — the content size a
`docker pull` transfers (`docker image inspect` `.Size` under Docker Desktop's
containerd image store) — 8.7× smaller. Uncompressed on disk it is 119 MB vs
762 MB (6.4×); of that, the stripped Issuerd release binary itself is ~52 MB
and the rest is the distroless base plus the krb5 shared libs (the Keycloak
figure is the optimized production image — the base image plus its persisted
build state). Either way: faster pulls, faster cold starts and a smaller CVE
surface (distroless: no shell, no package manager).

![Container image footprint](images/perf/image_size.png)

## 6. Disk and log sizing (measured)

### 6.1 Database size vs user count

Measured on the campaign's seeding ladder (3 → 1,003 → 25,548 → 115,548 users;
`users` + `credentials` table heap):

- Marginal cost per stored user: **≈702 B** (slope between the 1k and 115.5k
  points; includes the Argon2id password credential). PostgreSQL page
  granularity makes small populations look step-wise.
- Whole database at **115,548 users, steady state** (sessions/events wiped):
  **86.5 MiB** total (all tables + indexes), i.e. well under 1 GiB for a
  hundred-thousand-user directory. *(Extrapolated: 1 M users ≈ 0.7 GiB for
  users+credentials, ≈0.8 GiB whole DB — projection, not measured.)*
- The same database **before** wiping transient rows (102.8k live sessions,
  ~352k stored events incl. admin events): 220.3 MiB — i.e. **login churn can
  exceed user data** if events/sessions are never expired. Set
  `events_expiration_secs` per realm and rely on session expiry; dead tuples are
  reclaimed by autovacuum in normal operation.

![Database growth](images/perf/disk_users.png)

Reference: the Keycloak 26.7 database measured 15.9 MB after import (realm +
1,000 users) and 80.9 MB after its three matrices (≈5.5 M requests, ≈30k
logins). Keycloak 26 persists user sessions in the database by default, so its
database grows per login too — event persistence is still off in this setup
(§1.3).

### 6.2 Per-login and per-CIBA-cycle churn (Issuerd, measured)

Derived from table-size deltas over runs with known iteration counts:

| Artifact | Size |
|---|---:|
| login event row (`events`) | ≈322 B |
| `user_sessions` row | ≈259 B |
| `client_sessions` row | ≈204 B |
| **total per interactive login** | **≈785 B** (heap; indexes/WAL extra) |
| admin event row (provisioning audit) | ≈220 B |
| full CIBA cycle (bc-auth → approve → poll, all tables) | ≈1.18 KB |

### 6.3 Log volume (stdout, INFO, measured)

Issuerd logs every request span plus one INFO event per login/token issue.
Measured via `docker logs` byte deltas around dedicated 30–60 s bursts:

| Traffic | Log bytes / request |
|---|---:|
| discovery | ≈0.49 KB |
| client_credentials | ≈1.7 KB |
| CIBA | ≈1.2 KB |
| password_grant (login) | ≈1.75 KB |

Rule of thumb: `log bytes/day ≈ rps × bytes-per-request × 86,400`. Example: **100
logins/s ≈ 15 GB/day** at INFO *(arithmetic projection from the measured
per-request rate)*. For high-volume deployments run the app at WARN and/or ship
JSON logs to a collector with rotation. Keycloak writes almost nothing per
request by default (1.7 MB total after its whole 9-scenario medium matrix of
≈1.5 M requests — ≈1.2 B/request), so this line item is Issuerd-specific — the
trade-off for always-on audit detail.

### 6.4 Image + runtime disk budget

| Component | Disk |
|---|---:|
| Issuerd image (distroless) | 29.5 MB compressed pull size (119 MB on disk; the release binary alone is ~52 MB) |
| Database, 100k users, steady state | ~0.1 GiB |
| Database churn | ≈785 B × retained logins (until sessions/events expire) |
| Logs at INFO | ≈0.5–1.8 KB × requests (until rotated) |

## 7. Scale test: 100,000+ users

Seeded to **115,548 users** through the public Admin API (which also measures bulk
provisioning): **157 users/s sustained for 10.6 minutes** (100,000 users, each with
an Argon2id password — the hasher, not the insert, is the bottleneck; 10% of
requests were idempotent 409-skips by design). Against that database:

- `password_grant` over a **100,000 distinct-user pool** (no repeats): 128.5
  logins/s, p99 218.9 ms, 0 errors (a corroborating 120 s/40-VU run logged
  15,200 logins at 126.4 logins/s, p99 394.5 ms, 0 errors — session count
  verified in the DB snapshot). The same scenario on the 1k-user database ran
  131.9 logins/s, p99 215.6 ms — user count does not measurably affect the
  token path.
- `auth_code_flow` at 100k users: **103 full logins/s** (309 req/s), p99
  118.8 ms, 0 errors.
- The medium-tier headline rows for `discovery`, `client_credentials`, `ciba`,
  `password_grant` and `auth_code_flow` (§2) were measured against this
  115,548-user database (the Keycloak rows against its 1,000-user import —
  the 100k seeding ladder is Issuerd-only because it doubles as the
  provisioning-rate measurement).

## 8. Sizing guide (from the measurements above)

| Deployment | App container | PostgreSQL | Sustains (measured at that tier) |
|---|---|---|---|
| dev / edge | 1 CPU / 512 MiB | 1–2 CPU / 1 GiB | 73 logins/s · 860 cc/s · 7.3k userinfo/s · 188 CIBA cycles/s |
| standard | 2 CPU / 1 GiB | 2 CPU / 2 GiB | 129 logins/s · 1.6k cc/s · 14k userinfo/s · 285 CIBA cycles/s |
| high-volume | 4 CPU / 2 GiB | ≥4 CPU only for write-heavy CIBA/provisioning (reads are app-bound) | 222 logins/s · 3.4k cc/s · 26.3k userinfo/s · 446 CIBA cycles/s |

RAM headroom is generous: at the medium tier the app peaked at 158 MiB (bulk
provisioning; ≤121 MiB on every other scenario), and even at the large tier the
worst peak was 271 MiB against the 2 GiB limit — the 512 MiB small-tier limit is
mostly margin. Disk: §6.4. Multi-node horizontal scaling (shared PostgreSQL +
Redis, signing keys in storage) is covered in [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md).

## Appendix: in-process micro-benchmarks

The numbers above are end-to-end (k6 → Docker → Issuerd → PostgreSQL). The repo also
ships in-process benchmarks (in-process Axum harness, single core, no Docker) used for
regression gating:

> ```bash
> cargo test --test integration -- --ignored --nocapture
> ```

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Token issuance (password grant) | < 2 ms p99 | RS256 signing + storage write |
| Token validation (stateless JWT) | < 0.5 ms p99 | JWKS lookup + signature verify |
| Auth code flow (password) | < 50 ms p99 | Full redirect + login + code exchange |
| Throughput (token validation) | > 1000 req/s per core | UserInfo endpoint |
| Throughput (token issuance) | > 500 req/s per core | Password grant |

Benchmarks are marked `#[ignore = "benchmark"]` so they do not run in normal CI.
Results are printed to stdout and should be captured by the CI runner for trend analysis.
